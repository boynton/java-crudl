# java-crudl

A Java web service example using Jersey, Jackson, Jetty that implements CRUDL functionality over HTTP.

This example is a compromise between REST and RPC, a sort of RESTish pragmatic approach to web services on HTTP. For comparison,
look also a [this REST example](https://github.com/boynton/java-rest-crudl), as well as this
[JSON-RPC example](https://github.com/boynton/java-rpc-crudl).
